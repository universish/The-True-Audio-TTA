The True Audio (TTA) codec is a free, simple, realtime lossless audio compressor. The term «lossless» refers to the fact that such compression results in literally no data or quality loss. Based on adaptive prognostic filters, TTA has compared favorably to a majority of its popular open-source peers. The codec was built to offer adequate compression levels while maintaining high operation speeds.

TTA lossless audio codec performs lossless compression on multichannel 8, 16 and 24-bit data of WAV audio files. The term "lossless" refers to the fact that such compression results in literally no data or quality loss; when decompressed, the audio file data are bit-identical to those of their originals. Compression ratios achieved by the TTA codec vary, depending on music type, but range from 30% - 70% of the original. The TTA lossless compressed audio format supports both ID3v1/ID3v2 information tags, and also APEv2.

Using True Audio (TTA) lossless audio codec, you can store up to 20 audio compact-discs (CD) worth of music on a single DVD-R for playing, retaining the original CD quality audio, plus detailed information in the popular tags, such as ID3 и APE.

All TTA source code and binaries are freely available and distributed under Open Source license GPL. You may distribute and use the software and TTA codec documentation freely as long as you do not charge for it. Please contact us if you would like to redistribute it under different terms.

Our current specific emphasis is on optimization of the TTA lossless audio codec algorithms for easy hardware implementation - not necessarily maximum overall compression levels.

We are open for collaboration. Anytime you can contact us by e-mail info@tausoft.org.
